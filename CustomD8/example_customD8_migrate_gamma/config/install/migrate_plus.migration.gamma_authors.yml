source:
  # We use the XML source plugin.
  plugin: url
  data_fetcher_plugin: file
  data_parser_plugin: xml
  # Normally, this is one or more fully-qualified URLs or file paths. Because
  # we can't hardcode your local URL, we provide a relative path here which
  # hook_install() will rewrite to a full URL for the current site.
  urls:
    - public://gamma/data/export_1.xml
    - public://gamma/data/export_2.xml
    - public://gamma/data/export_3.xml
  # Visit the URL above (relative to your site root) and look at it. You can see
  # that <response> is the outer element, and each item we want to import is a
  # <position> element. The item_xpath value is the xpath to use to query the
  # desired elements.
  item_selector: /rev5:document/rev5:article/rev5:author
  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an xpath for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_xpath.
  fields:
    -
      name: author_id
      label: 'Author ID'
      selector: 'rev5:db-id'
    -
      name: author_firstname
      label: 'Author First Name'
      selector: 'rev5:first-name'
    -
      name: author_lastname
      label: 'Author Last Name'
      selector: 'rev5:last-name'

  # Under 'ids', we identify source fields populated above which will uniquely
  # identify each imported item. The 'type' makes sure the migration map table
  # uses the proper schema type for stored the IDs.
  ids:
    # Was originally author ID, but this is an array and causes
    # to break, using article ID instead.

      type: string

    domain: 'www_gamma_com'
